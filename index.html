        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 8, 2026</p>

        <p>Rishabh Chandel ("we," "our," or "us") built the <strong>SIP Calculator + Planner</strong> app (the "App") as a free, ad-supported application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our App.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The App itself does not require you to create an account, provide your name, email address, or any personal information. All calculation data (SIP, Lumpsum, SWP calculations, goals, and history) is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Advertising</h2>
        <p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements within the App. AdMob may automatically collect certain information to serve and measure ads, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> (e.g., advertising ID)</li>
            <li><strong>Usage data</strong> (e.g., app interactions, ad interactions)</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising data</strong> (e.g., ads viewed, ads clicked)</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostic data</strong> (e.g., crash logs, performance data)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected and processed by Google in accordance with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how Google uses information from apps that use their services</a>.</p>
        <p>This data is <strong>not linked to your personal identity</strong> and is used solely for the purpose of serving relevant advertisements and measuring ad performance.</p>

        <h2>3. Apple's App Tracking Transparency</h2>
        <p>On iOS 14.5 and later, the App may request your permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. You can choose to allow or deny this request. If you deny tracking, you will still see ads, but they may be less relevant to you. You can change this setting at any time in your device's Settings under Privacy &amp; Tracking.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All your financial calculations, saved goals, investment history, and preferences are stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. We do not have access to this data, and it is not uploaded to any server. If you uninstall the App, this data will be permanently deleted.</p>

        <h2>5. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>We want to be transparent about what we do not collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
            <li>Financial account numbers, bank details, or payment information</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Photos, camera, or microphone data</li>
            <li>Health or fitness data</li>
            <li>Browsing history</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
